## Prerequisites and Assumptions

No prerequisites

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

- This image doesn't do much on it's own, you must use a complemenary service to pass messages or data to it via port 783.

## Installation
### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/ryanwclark/plex) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull ryanwclark/plex:(imagetag)
```
The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Version | Container OS | Tag       |
| ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| latest  | Alpine       | `:latest` |
| 6       | Alpine       | `:6`      |
| 5       | Alpine       | `:5`      |

#### Multi Archictecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v6`, `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Make [networking ports](#networking) available for public access if necessary
### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Parameter    | Description           |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| `/data/db`   | Application Directory |
| `/data/logs` | Logfiles              |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/ryanwclark/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`,`nano`,`vim`.

Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                  | Description                            |

## Support

These images were built to serve a specific need in a production environment and gradually have had more functionality added based on requests from the community.
### Usage
- The [Discussions board](../../discussions) is a great place for working with the community on tips and tricks of using this image.

### Bugfixes
- Please, submit a [Bug Report](issues/new) if something isn't working as expected. I'll do my best to issue a fix in short order.

### Feature Requests
- Feel free to submit a feature request, however there is no guarantee that it will be added, or at what timeline.


### Updates
- Best effort to track upstream changes, More priority if I am actively using the image in a production environment.
